Hi, I am Ananna. I love to write. This blog is all about my thoughts, reflections, learning, untouchable emotions and my research. Sometimes, we can't decipher what we are thinking, what are the internal souces of a perticular emotion. Sometimes, we don't want to know about those sources and othertime we do. To me, it's important to know what actually I am thinking, how I am thinking, and why I am thinking. This blog is a way of learning about my thoughts. Another important thing is to understand my learning process and what I am learning. This is also a big theme of this blog which includes the questions I frequently face or are asked by my closest ones. If you are reading this, you are curious enough to know me. Are you that much curious to know yourself?
