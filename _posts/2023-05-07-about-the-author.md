Hi, I am Ananna. I love to write. This blog is all about my thoughts, reflections, learning, untouchable emotions and my research. Sometimes, we can't decipher what we are thinking, what are the internal souces of a perticular emotion. Sometimes, we don't want to know about those sources and othertime we do. To me, it's important to know what actually I am thinking, how I am thinking, and why I am thinking. This blog is a way of learning about my thoughts.
