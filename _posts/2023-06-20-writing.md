I don't know why sometimes I feel so melancholic.  And I think this is the first step to go into deep sadness. If your brain develops a taste to go into this deep sadness state continuously and consistently after some days it can go into the depression phase. Whenever you can identify this state kindly break it somehow. It will help you in the long run.
